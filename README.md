### *Abstract*


*Objectives*. This study attempts to introduce the Driving  Locus  of  Control  (DLoC),  a  method focused on the internal or external source of at-tribution of the driving behaviour, to the Czech context. This  study  also  relates  DLoC  to  atti-tudes towards autonomous vehicles (AVs).

*Participants  and  setting*.Out  of  the  general population, 59 inquirers personally interviewed (CAPI) 1 065 respondents (49% women) in the age range between 15 and 92 years (M = 50, SD = 17). The respondents were sampled via multi-stage random sampling procedure, based on the list of addresses in the Czech Republic.

*Hypotheses*.The  authors  hypothesised  to  rep-licate  the  original  two-factor  structure  of  the DLOC Scale and that the higher levels of inter-nal DLoC result in not considering the improve-ment in traffic safety as the AVs replace human drivers.

*Statistical analysis*.Confirmatory factor analy-sis was used to analyse the factor structure of DLoC Scale. Hypotheses related to the empirical  validity  of  the  method  were  assessed  via structural  equation  modelling.  Reliability  of DLoC Scale was calculated in terms of internal consistency (McDonald coefficient).

*Results*.Confirmatory  factor  analysis  revealed reasonably  good  support  for  structural  valid-ity of the one-dimensional DLoC-CZ15 factor model  (χ2 = 426.967, df = 90, CFI = 0.964, TLI = 0.958, SRMR = 0.066, RMSEA = 0.065). In  addition,  the  one-dimensional  DLoC-CZ15 factor  model  showed  acceptable  internal  con-sistency - ω = 0.9 (95% CI [0.89, 0.91]). The structural equation modelling found a relation-ship between DLoC and some of the items cap-turing attitudes towards AVs, too.

*Study limitations*.The analysed data were obtained via interviews between respondents and inquirers. As a result, the study does not contain indicators of empirical validity measured by a methodologically different approach, such as an observation of driving behaviour.
